# Chess Flashcards

### Purpose
As an aspiring tournament player, I want to improve my Chess skills, but I've noticed that I have a problem with retention. I forget a lot of what I study in the days and weeks following. Chess Flashcards is an attempt to remedy my forgetfulness.

### Functionality
Chess Flashcards enables the user to create, add to, and quiz on a repertoire of Chess puzzles. New puzzles are added by supplying a name and a FEN and then making the correct move for the puzzle.
