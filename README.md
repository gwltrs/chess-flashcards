# Chess Flashcards

### Purpose
As an aspiring tournament player, I want to improve my Chess skills, but I've noticed that I have a problem with retention. I forget a lot of what I study in the days and weeks following. I made this app to quiz me on my past mistakes in games and on previous lessons learned in books and videos.

### Functionality
Chess Flashcards enables the user to create, add to, and quiz on a repertoire of Chess puzzles. New puzzles are added by supplying a name and a FEN and then making the correct move for the puzzle. The user can also review previously-added puzzles. The app uses a spaced repetition system to determine when and how often puzzles are shown to the user for review. Newly-added and recently-missed puzzles are reviewed more frequently.

### Getting Started
To use, download or clone this repo and open index.html in Chrome or Firefox. On the first screen, create a new puzzles data file or load an existing one. Remember to save your file after adding puzzles and/or reviewing previous puzzles. I recommend backing up your puzzles data file somewhere like Google Drive or Github.
